Apache Felix

While Sling does not require a specific OSGi framework implementation to run in,
Sling is being developed using Apache Felix as the OSGi framework implementation. 
It has not been tested yet, but it is expected that Sling also operates perfectly inside other OSGi frameworks
such as Equinox and Knopflerfish.
